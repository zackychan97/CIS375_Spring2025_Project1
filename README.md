<h1>CollabraNation - Dakota State University</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In todayâ€™s fast-paced academic environment, effective collaboration between faculty and students is essential to drive innovation and enhance the learning experience. The "Idea Tracker" web application is envisioned as an interactive platform designed to bridge the gap between faculty-led research initiatives and student enthusiasm.
